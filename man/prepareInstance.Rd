\arguments{
\item{gmatrix}{gmatrix with imputed missing values.}

\item{imputationResults}{matrix of the same dimensions as \code{gmatrix}
filled with values TRUE/FALSE indicating which genotypes were imputed.}

\item{controlsU}{Reference U matrix from SVD decomposition of centered
genotype matrix of control dataset or joint dataset.}

\item{meanControl}{numeric vector representing mean per-variant genotype,
that were taken as a center while costructing \code{controlsU} matrix.}

\item{outputFileName}{name of the YAML file to output.}

\item{clusters}{clustering object.}

\item{title}{title to put as a first line in yaml file.}

\item{MAC}{minor allele count used for QC.}

\item{MAF}{minor allele frequency used for QC.}

\item{knn_drop}{fraction of samples that would be excluded from dataset at
each level of hierarchy clustering by applying knn anomaly
detection algorithm.}

\item{normalize_drop}{fraction of samples to be excluded from dataset at
each level of hierarchy clustering by applying
function \code{normal_subsample}
from the package.}

\item{keptSamplesFile}{Optional. File to save the names of kept samples.}
