#' SVD-based ancestry prediction
#' 
#' Requires several left singular vector bases from every ancestry to be detected. 
#' 1000 genomes data could be used as training set for creation of reference SVD bases. 
#' Sample genotypes vector is reconstructed from every supplied basis and basis
#'  with a smallest relative residual vector norm is chosen as sampleâ€™s ancestry.
#' @param SampleVector Vector of genotypes for a sample
#' @param ReferenceUList List object containing matrices of the left singular
#'  vectors for every ancestry reference
#' @param SV Number of singular vectors to use
#' @param AncestryList Vector of ancestry names
